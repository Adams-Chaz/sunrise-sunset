## Time Breakdown

**15min** - Create App, import all the necessary packages.
**15min** - General layout, Form.
**30min** - Converted API calls to use the REDUX pattern, setup store, define models.
**15min** - Pull out logic into a Provider/Context.
**45min** - Dynamic background, based on local Sunrise and Sunset time.

### General Notes

- I went with React combined with Typescript, It does slow down compile time a little, but the pre-compile type validation far out weighs the downsides.

- I'm using [Material-UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/), for all the components, theme, icons, etc. Bootstrap was nice, but this open source library, I feel provides a better experience. 

- For component placement, I'm using [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/). It's similar to Bootstrap, but provides additional styling elements.
